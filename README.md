# ReactNativeFirebaseCameraIOS

This is a basic React Native Firebase Camera starter projects<br />
I made this to be able to quickley start project RN Camera apps. Please feel free to make edits<br />

It uses lwansbrough [react-native-camera camera compentent](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera)<br />.
Make sure you add the compent to your project and fill out your firebase creds
